# Spin

# Backup

TODO (orduno)

# Next Steps
- Check for collision before executing a primitive. [Issue 379](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/379) and [Issue 533](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/533).
- We might want to have `nav2_motion_primitives` not as a separate package/node but part of the robot. [Issue 378](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/378).
