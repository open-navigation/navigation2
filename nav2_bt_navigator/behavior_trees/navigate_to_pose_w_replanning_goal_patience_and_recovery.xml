<!--
  This Behavior Tree replans the global path periodically at 1 Hz and it also has
  recovery actions specific to planning / control as well as general system issues. 
  This will be continuous if a kinematically valid planner is selected.
  Additionally it has a feature to wait near the goal to have a new valid plan 
  if the old plan becomes invalid before trying to drive significantly 
  around by a length factor.
