CHANGELOG
- new navigate through poses navigator
- abstract out this logic to allow for expansion (but not plugins)
- create a new onComplete callback in the bt action server to populate results meaningfully or indicate completion
- make sure only 1 navigator at a time can be processed with a muxer handled for plugins automatically
- nav through poses cull pts passed so don't replan through old areas
- fixed an issue allowing a failure in processing the simple action server from making the BT navigator lock up and think its still processing indefinitely.
- added completion callback option to the simple action server in case it terminates on its own from un-handled exceptions thrown

Qs:
- Should culling happen in a new BT node (TruncateOldPosesFromPath?), is this way catching all reasonable edge cases?



// TODO

// Default Bt for nav to pose and nav through poses (or remove all defaults?)
// test culling of points in navigator, close calls, loops, switchbacks, different quadrants, etc

// TODOs? (BT node vs feedback, hardcoded xml in panel, adding "goal" to NTP due to default load and blackboard)
// system test case (nav through N poses, shows never stops, show get within 1m of each goal, pass)

// Doxygen
// plugins list + migration guide + config guide
// readme + plugins in libs list config/defaults + sync BTnodes.xml file for groot
// Create nav BT provided XML list (is that somewhere? if not, make it)
