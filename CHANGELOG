CHANGELOG
- new navigate through poses navigator
- abstract out this logic to allow for expansion (but not plugins)
- create a new onComplete callback in the bt action server to populate results meaningfully or indicate completion
- make sure only 1 navigator at a time can be processed with a muxer handled for plugins automatically
- nav through poses cull pts passed so don't replan through old areas

Qs:
- Should culling happen in a new BT node (TruncateOldPosesFromPath?), is this way catching all reasonable edge cases?



// TODO
// [DONE] Separate out the NavToPose and NavThruPose onloop/preempt/goal/initial goal pose set
// [DONE] make actions mutually exclusive (only 1 can be running at a time)
// [DONE] make abstract navigator that these inherit
// [DONE] make navigate through poses plugin
// [DONE] move muxer checks into header
// [NOT POSSIBLE] make navigator plugins / vector -> can get to load, but need to know ActionT that's impossible to get from
  // a base class

// [DONE] test navigate to pose still works (done, preemption, cancel), feedback is still good
// [DONE] on completion being called
// [DONE] topic working for navigate to pose
// [DONE] test navigate through poses plugin "works" (can nav, but check logging things properly called)
// [DONE] test muxer updates state with done, preemption, cancel

// [DONE] BT XML node for ComputePathThroughPoses
// [DONE] BT XML file of feature using ComputePathThroughPoses/goals
// [DONE] navigate to pose XML Bt node create new navigate through pose Bt node (for system)

// [DONE] method for culling out and reporting the number of poses remaining to navigate through poses feedback
// [DONE] planner_server action ComputePathThroughPoses fill out to compute paths between each pose and append them to a final path
// [DONE] rviz plugin use this next to WP follower for demos

// [DONE] test ComputePathThroughPoses action: NavFn, Smac, compute time
// [DONE] NavigateThroughPoses action basic functioning, issue, cancel, complete.
// [DONE] XML testing
// [DONE] test ComputePathThroughPoses BT node: take goals and send to action server, puts path on blackboard for FollowPaths
// [DONE] test muxer when having both actually running
// [DONE] preemption testing
// Default Bt for nav to pose and nav through poses (or remove all defaults?)
// test culling of points in navigator, close calls, loops, switchbacks, different quadrants, etc
// random any::cast issues popping up
// edge case if num goals = 0 (back()'s)
// rviz cancel button state issues
// move navigators back into src

// TODOs?
// system test case (nav through N poses, shows never stops, show get within 1m of each goal, pass)

// Doxygen
// plugins list + migration guide + config guide
// readme + plugins in libs list config/defaults + sync BTnodes.xml file for groot
// Create nav BT provided XML list (is that somewhere? if not, make it)
