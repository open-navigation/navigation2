CHANGELOG
- new navigate through poses navigator
- abstract out this logic to allow for expansion (but not plugins)
- create a new onComplete callback in the bt action server to populate results meaningfully or indicate completion
- make sure only 1 navigator at a time can be processed with a muxer handled for plugins automatically
- nav through poses cull pts passed so don't replan through old areas

Qs:
- Should culling happen in a new BT node (TruncateOldPosesFromPath?), is this way catching all reasonable edge cases?
