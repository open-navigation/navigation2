ROS2 Navigation System

# Overview
The ROS 2 Navigation System is the control system that enables a robot to autonomously reach a goal state, such as a specific position and orientation relative to a specific map. Given a current pose, a map, and a goal, such as a destination pose, the navigation system generates a plan to reach the goal, and outputs commands to autonomously drive the robot, respecting any safety constraints and avoiding obstacles encountered along the way.
