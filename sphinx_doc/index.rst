Overview
########

The |PN| project is a set of ROS2 components that help you build a robot that
can drive around.

It has tools to:

- load and store maps
- localize the robot on the map
- plan a path from A to B around obstacles
- control the robot as it follows the path and avoid any obstacles along the way
- convert sensor data into a costmap representation of the world
- build complicated robot behaviors using behavior trees

These all work seemlessly together, so that, with a bit of customization for your
robot, you can just give it a destination and off it go.

Here you will find documentation on how to install and use |PN| with a Turtlebot
3, as well as how to customize it for other robots, tune the behavior for better
performance, as well as customize the internals for advanced results.
