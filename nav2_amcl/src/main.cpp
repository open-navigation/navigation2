  // Depending on a persons particular setup, most of the time when a laser
  // scan message is received, the transform for it is not available yet. With
  // the previous implementation, AMCL would discard that data. On some machines
  // we could go for thousands of scans without a successful transform resulting
  // in basically an unusable system. Lacking message filters, the fix for this
  // is to enable transform timeouts, however, at the moment, transform timeouts
  // hang when use_sim_time is active. This workaround creates a seperate node
  // for the sole purpose of provide a clock that can keep updating when the
  // transform code is in a tight loop waiting for transform data or the timeout.
